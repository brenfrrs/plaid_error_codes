## Example Record

KeyBank, Interactive Brokers, and Betterment are examples of institutions that require this setup.The user selected the wrong institution.Plaid supports institutions that have multiple login portals for the various products they offer, and it is common for users to confuse a different selection for the one which their credentials would actually be accepted.This confusion is particularly common between Vanguard (brokerage accounts) and My Vanguard Plan (retirement accounts). This is also common for users attempting to link prepaid stored-value cards, as many institutions have separate login portals specifically for those cards.",

## Usage 

The JSONL file can be loaded into a database or used in a internal company application to provide detailed information about error codes. The purpose for including the HTML blocks is to make this information easier to embed, if needed. You should always refer to the [Plaid API documentation](https://plaid.com/docs/errors/) for the most accurate and up to date information. I do not guarantee that this file is up to date with the latest error codes.
